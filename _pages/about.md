My academic journey is rooted in France, where I completed both my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Computational Linguistics at Sorbonne Université, with a strong focus on the intersection of language and computer science. Before that, I studied French Literature at Nanjing University of Finance and Economics in China.
