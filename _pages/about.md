I am a [CIFRE](https://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/fr/les-cifre-46510) PhD student at [Sorbonne Université](https://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/fr/les-cifre-46510) in collaboration with [LEADBAY](https://www.leadbay.ai), working on knowledge hypergraphs and neural networks for multimedia and multimodal data with applications in B2B sales. My research focuses on developing innovative AI solutions that bridge the gap between semantic knowledge representation and practical business applications.

**Background**

My academic journey is rooted in France, where I completed both my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Computational Linguistics at Sorbonne Université, with a strong focus on the intersection of language and computer science. Before that, I studied French Literature at Nanjing University of Finance and Economics in China, which laid the foundation for my interest in language and culture. This interdisciplinary background has shaped my unique perspective on the convergence of linguistics, technology, and business.

**Research Interests**

My research interests span several interconnected areas:
Artificial Intelligence, Semantic Web, Knowledge Graphs, Natural Language Processing.
