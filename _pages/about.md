======
I am a [CIFRE](https://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/fr/les-cifre-46510) PhD student at [Sorbonne Université](https://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/fr/les-cifre-46510) in collaboration with [LEADBAY](https://www.leadbay.ai), working on knowledge hypergraphs and neural networks for multimedia and multimodal data with applications in B2B sales. My research focuses on developing innovative AI solutions that bridge the gap between semantic knowledge representation and practical business applications.

I have a master’s degree in Linguistics and Computer Science and a bachelor’s degree in Linguistics and NLP, both from Sorbonne-Université.
