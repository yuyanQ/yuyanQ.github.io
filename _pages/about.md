======
I am a [CIFRE](https://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/fr/les-cifre-46510) PhD student at [Sorbonne Université](https://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/fr/les-cifre-46510) in collaboration with [LEADBAY](https://www.leadbay.ai), working on knowledge hypergraphs and neural networks for multimedia and multimodal data with applications in B2B sales. My research focuses on developing innovative AI solutions that bridge the gap between semantic knowledge representation and practical business applications.

My academic journey has been quite diverse – I began with a bachelor's degree in French Literature from Nanjing 
University of Finance and Economic in China, then transitioned to computational linguistics at Sorbonne Université 
where I completed both my bachelor's and master's degrees in Linguistics and Computer Science. This 
interdisciplinary background gives me a unique perspective on how language, technology, and business intersect.

**Research Interests**

My research interests span several interconnected areas:
Artificial Intelligence, Semantic Web, Knowledge Graphs, Natural Language Processing.
